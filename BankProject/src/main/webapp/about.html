     <h1> 2. How to Securely Share Banking Information</h1>
     <p>  Here are tips to share your banking details safely:

✅ Use encrypted communication: Send info over secure platforms (e.g., Signal, encrypted email). <br>

✅ Share only what’s necessary: Avoid oversharing — account number and name might be enough. <br>

❌ Avoid public channels: Never share on social media, forums, or unsecured websites. <br>

✅ Use PDF with a password: If sending over email, consider encrypting your document. <br>

✅ Verify the recipient: Double-check that you're sending it to the correct person or business.
